    <p> Preliminary 2025 reporting to the 311 system reveals a clear geography of rat activity across New York City.<br>
        <br>In the first 11 months of the year, the area with the highest number of rat sightings reported to 311 was the West Bronx — specifically the neighborhoods of Highbridge, Concourse and Morris Heights (10452 zip code) — with 647 sightings. <br>
        <br>The second most rat-dense area was is in Brooklyn, which includes Flatbush, East Flatbush and Midwood (11226), recording 498 sightings.<br>
        <br>Notably, the third highest total was recorded in the Upper West Side-Morningside Heights area (10025), with 459 sightings. Manhattan’s Community Board 9, which includes part of this area, was the first in New York City to have all of its trash fully containerized.
