<h2>
    <p>Preliminary 2025 reporting to the 311 system reveals a clear geography of rat activity across New York City.</p>
</h2> 

    <p>In the first 11 months of the year, the area with the highest number of rat sightings reported to 311 was the West Bronx — specifically the neighborhoods of Highbridge, Concourse and Morris Heights (10452 zip code). <br>
        <br>The second most rat-dense area was is in Brooklyn, which includes Flatbush, East Flatbush and Midwood (11226).<br>
        <br>Notably, the third highest total was recorded in the Upper West Side-Morningside Heights area (10025). Manhattan’s Community Board 9, which includes part of this area, was the first in New York City to have all of its trash fully containerized.
